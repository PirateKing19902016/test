\title{problem PeakSegFPOP}
\description{Run PeakSegFPOP_disk on one genomic segmentation problem
directory, and read the result files into R. Actually, this
function will first check if the result files are already present
(and consistent), and if so, it will simply read them into R
(without running PeakSegFPOP_disk) -- this is a caching mechanism
that can save a lot of time.}
\usage{problem.PeakSegFPOP(problem.dir, penalty.str)}
\arguments{
  \item{problem.dir}{Path to a directory like sampleID/problems/problemID which
contains a coverage.bedGraph file with the aligned read counts for
one genomic segmentation problem.}
  \item{penalty.str}{Penalty parameter to pass to PeakSegFPOP_disk.}
}

\value{List of data.tables: segments has one row for every segment in the
optimal model, loss has one row and contains the Poisson loss and
feasibility, and timing is one row with the time and disk usage.}
